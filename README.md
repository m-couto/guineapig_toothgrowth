# Guinea Pig Tooth Growth Analysis

This is an analysis of the tooth growth of guinea pigs, given different doses of vitamin C. We started by exploring and summarizing the data, and then performed a few hypothesis tests and reached some conclusions on the most effective amounts of vitamin C dose and the type of delivery that leads to larger tooth growth.

The project code can be found in `project_code2.R` and the report in the files `report2.Rmd` and `report.pdf`.

This project was developed within the Statistical Inference course in the Data Science specialization.
